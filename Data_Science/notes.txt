Types Linear Regression:-

1) Simple Linear Regression
2) Mutliple Linear Regression
3) Polynomial Regression
4) Support Vector For Regression
5) Random Forest Regression

A)Linear Regression

1) Simple Linear Regression:-
simple Linear Regression is a statistical method that allows us to summarize and study relation between two continuos variables.

y=b0+(b1*x1)
y=Dependent variable(DV)
b0=Constant
b1=Coefficient
x1=Independent variable

Example:-
Suppose You have a data set Of Salary and experience and if you have to predict the value of Salary
[y=b0+(b1*x1)]
Salary=b0+b1*experience

Type of error[ error=sum(y-y^)^2 -> min ]


2) Mutliple Linear Regression:-
Multiple linear regression attempts to model the relationship between two or more explanatory variables and a response variable by fitting a linear equation to observed data.


y=b0+b*1*1 + b2*b2 + bn+bn

3)Polynomial Linear Regression:-Polynomial regression is a special case of linear regression where we fit a polynomial equation on the data with a curvilinear relationship between the target variable and the independent variables.

y=b0+b1*x1+b2*x2^+bn+xn^n

B)Non-Linear Regression

Support Vector Regression

SVM

** in simple regression we try to minimise ,is a the error while in SVR we trt to fit the error within a certain threshold


Kernel:The function used to map a lower dimensional data into a higher dimensional data.

Hyper Plane:In SVM this is basically The separation line between the data classes. although in svr we are going to define it as the line that will help us predict the continuos value or target value.

Boundary line: in SVM there are two lines other than Hyper plane which create a margin. the Support vector can be on the boundary lines or outside it. this boundary line separates the two classes.in SVR the concept is same.

Supprt Vectors:This are the data points which are closest to the boundary.the distance of the points is minimum or least.



CART:-
(classification and regression tree)
a cart is a predictive model which explains how an outcome variable's value can be predicted on other value . a cart's output is a decision tree where each fork is a split in a predictor variable and each end node contains a prediction for outcome variable. 

RTF:
Random Forest Tree


statistic:

[600,470,170,430,300]
calculate the Mean
334
then
calculate the diffrence
then
Squre Them then divide it to by mean value calculate the variance
Standard Deviation =Root(variance)



Correlation:-

There Must Be Cause and effect relationship, simultaneous channges in two variables

1,Positive Correlation(same direction of  both, income to expense)
2,Negetive Correlation(different direction of  both, income to demand)

R-Squared(R^2):
