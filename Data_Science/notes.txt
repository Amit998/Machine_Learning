Types Linear Regression:-

1) Simple Linear Regression
2) Mutliple Linear Regression
3) Polynomial Regression
4) Support Vector For Regression
5) Random Forest Regression

1) Simple Linear Regression:-
simple Linear Regression is a statistical method that allows us to summarize and study relation between two continuos variables.

y=b0+(b1*x1)
y=Dependent variable(DV)
b0=Constant
b1=Coefficient
x1=Independent variable

Example:-
Suppose You have a data set Of Salary and experience and if you have to predict the value of Salary
[y=b0+(b1*x1)]
Salary=b0+b1*experience

Type of error[ error=sum(y-y^)^2 -> min ]
