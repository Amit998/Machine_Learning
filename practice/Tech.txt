First We Need The Dataset which we can easily find into kaggle
Then We have To Take Main Features Where The main Data will be dependent on. like The Area, rooms Number, bathroom parking,rooms , spaces,
Then We Have To Preprocess The Data Like.
We Have To Convert The data of a string into Integer Value Which We can Do using labelEncoding
then we have to simplify the data by replacing all the nulls with mean,
then after that we have to divide it into train and test datasets.
we are going to put 90% values into training data,
then we have to call linearRegression model
then we have to fit the values into the the model
after that we can predict the value
